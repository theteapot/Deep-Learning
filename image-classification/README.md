## Image Classification

Classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset using a convolutional neural network. This CNN (ConvNet) will be implemented using Googles Tensorflow, which comes preinstalled (along with other applications) with bitfusion.io.

Will be powered by [bitfusion.io](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01EYKBEQ0) on AWS to leverage Nvidia GPUs as opposed to CPUs. CPUs are better at working with complex computations, where as GPUs have more through put and can get more work done in the same amount of time (which is better for NNs that have a lot of data to process or that include many hidden layers).
